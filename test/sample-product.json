The result is softer skin, shinier hair, brighter laundry, and longer-lasting home equipment.\nThe EVOSOFT‚Ñ¢ Cabinet 32K also includes a **smart metered valve** that regenerates only when needed, conserving both salt and water for maximum efficiency. Designed for easy installation and low maintenance, it delivers reliable, professional-grade performance ‚Äî direct from the factory to your home.\n",
