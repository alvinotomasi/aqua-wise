    "Extended Description": "The EVOSOFT™ Cabinet Style 32K brings advanced softening technology to homes that demand performance without bulk. Its compact, all-in-one cabinet design integrates the brine tank and resin tank into a single sleek unit, making it perfect for tight spaces while maintaining full efficiency.\nAt its core, the system features **Aldex C-800 10% crosslinked resin**, engineered to resist chlorine degradation and provide long-term performance on city water. By removing hardness minerals like calcium and magnesium, it prevents scale buildup that damages plumbing, fixtures, and appliances. The result is softer skin, shinier hair, brighter laundry, and longer-lasting home equipment.\nThe EVOSOFT™ Cabinet 32K also includes a **smart metered valve** that regenerates only when needed, conserving both salt and water for maximum efficiency. Designed for easy installation and low maintenance, it delivers reliable, professional-grade performance — direct from the factory to your home.\n",
